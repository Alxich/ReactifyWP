      <p>
        If youâ€™ve been to New York City and have walked the streets, it is easy
        to figure out how to get from one place to another because of the grid
        system that the city is built on. Just as the predictability of a city
        grid helps locals and tourists get around easily, so do webpage grids
        provide a structure that guides users and designers alike. Because of
        their consistent reference point, grids improve page readability and
        scannability and allow people to quickly get where they need to go.

        There are three common grid types used in websites and interfaces:
        column grid, modular grid, and hierarchical grid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Column grid involves dividing a page into vertical columns. UI elements
        and content are then aligned to these columns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modular grid extends the column grid further by adding rows to it. This
        intersection of columns and rows make up modules to which elements and
        content are aligned. Modular grids are great for ecommerce and listing
        pages, as rows are repeatable to accommodate browsing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hierarchical grid: Content is organized by importance using columns,
        rows, and modules. The most important elements and pieces of content
        take up the biggest pieces of the grid.
      </p>
      <h4>Breaking Down the Grid</h4>
      <p>
        Regardless of the type of grid you are using, the grid is made up of
        three elements: columns, gutters, and margins.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Columns:</b> Columns take up most of the real estate in a grid.
        Elements and content are placed in columns. To adapt to any screen size,
        column widths are generally defined with percentages rather than fixed
        values and the number of columns will vary. For example, a grid on a
        mobile device might have 4 columns and a grid on a desktop might have 12
        columns.
